// This file acts as a central export hub for all components in the 'components' folder.
// This allows you to import all components from this file instead of importing each one individually.
// This is useful for cleaner imports and better organization.
// Example: Instead of importing each component individually, you can use `import { Navbar, Filters } from './components';`
